dbweb: a declarative MVC web framework:

*****

Introduction
Desktop-databases are perfect for rapid GUI prototyping: GUI forms are always at sync with the database --- without any explicit programming. However, many of these products under-perform in web production environments. 

<dbweb> is an Apache2-based web framework that provides rapid prototyping as well as robust production out of the box. You can write a fully CRUD-functional web application (including complex master detail semantics) in HTML-like syntax! 
Additionally, <dbweb> introduces specialized input elements such as ComboBox or DataGrid. These allow for handling very large data-sets as they fetch the data on demand and do not require data pagination.

All your application code (e.g. invoked from buttons, context menus or by data editing) runs server-side.
<dbweb> applications are nevertheless fully interactive and provide  confirm-dialogs or GUI-animation effects for immediate feedback. This is possible through Ajax technology. The Ajax-layer is hidden  to the  application developer by default.
An object oriented API provides access to the database through a thin object-relational mapper.
